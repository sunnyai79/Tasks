ABC Bonding - Bail Bond,(805) 250-6973,http://www.bailbondsabc.com,"948 Santa Rosa St San Luis Obispo, CA 93401",greg@bailbondsabc.com,"No one ever wants to wake up in the middle of the night to a call from their spouse or their child who has just been booked into custody at the county jail. While the choices that landed the person you love into jail cannot be erased, you can control what happens next. Consulting a reliable bail bonds company who will help you get the one you love out of custody in a timely manner is one of the best choices that you can make during such an emotional time. 
 
Gregory L. Sullivan opened ABC Bonding in San Luis Obispo in 1993. He strategically selected an office located right across the street from the San Luis Obispo Superior Court. As the first bail bonds agency to open downtown, it has become a well-known name in the industry. Mr. Sullivan has more than 30 years of industry experience and helps the community by offering defendants who have been arrested a variety of bonds and appeals. 
  
We understand that the bonds industry is unique in that virtually every company charges the same rate to post bail. Since pricing is typically similar for all signature bonds and surety bonds, we know that quality service is what makes a difference. This is why we go above and beyond to give our clients peace of mind during a stressful situation. 
  
ABC Bonding offers home appointments so that families are not inconvenienced, and we offer a no-cost consultation. It is also possible to request private investigations and to have warrants handled in the privacy of our office. As a one-stop shop for bail bond services, it is only fair to say ""It is better to know us and not need us than to need us and not know us.""","Bail Bonds, Financial Services, Loans"
